"""
The pool at a glance, redrawn every time a sample is written.

One figure, six questions:

    who is doing the work      routing share over the last `survival_chars`
    who is close to dying      staleness as a fraction of the window prune
                               deletes on, with both thresholds marked
    how concentrated is it     cumulative share against rank
    does the gate mean use     it does not, and this is the panel that says so
    how has the pool moved     size and dying share over the run
    are new experts earning    usage against birth order

Reads the checkpoint and runs/expert_history.jsonl. No torch, no GPU - it is
meant to run while training owns the card.
