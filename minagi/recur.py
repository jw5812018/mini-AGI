"""Latent recurrence with adaptive depth.

The same blocks are applied repeatedly to a hidden state that is never decoded,
so a small number of distinct blocks becomes a much larger number of block
applications. Each character decides for itself how many passes it needs
(PonderNet-style halting) and stops when another pass would not change the
answer.

`RecurConfig.n_layer_effective` is the authority on that arithmetic; anything
that quotes it should read it rather than recompute it.

        Choose the working set from THIS text, by reading it once first.

        demand() scores the states the call sites routed on while reading the
        previous chunk, and that is the right evidence in the middle of a
        passage: text is locally coherent, and what the last few hundred
        characters needed is a fair guess at what the next few hundred will.

        At a boundary it is not evidence at all. The first chunk of a new
        passage, and a prompt, have no previous chunk of their own - so the
        buffer still holds the states of whatever was read last, which is a
        different subject entirely. demand() then answers a question nobody
        asked: it returns the same working set for a chess game and a Python
        file, because the text it is scoring is neither of them. Measured: the
        same buffer with two different prompts gave byte-identical working
        sets.

        So read the chunk once and score on its own states - but read it FROM
        A FIXED STARTING SET, because the read alone is not enough.

        The peek routes through the pool at every recurrence step, so the
        states it collects depend on two things: the text, and whichever
        experts happened to be resident when it began. The second is the
        previous subject, and it does not wash out - measured over seven
        passages, peeking from wherever the last one left off gave 4.8
        different working sets for one prompt, and re-reading up to three
        times still gave 3.3.

        Pinning the starting set to a constant removes that input. The states
        are then a function of the text alone, and the same passage chooses
        the same experts whatever preceded it - 1.0 distinct working sets
        across the same seven passages, and one answer per arithmetic prompt
        instead of two. A boundary is meant to be a blank slate; this is what
        makes it one.

        The constant is the top of the gate rather than an arbitrary set.
        Any fixed set gives the invariance, since all that matters is that it
        never changes. Taking the experts that have earned the most means the
        peek also reads with competent ones, so the states it hands to
        demand() are worth scoring: on the nine sample prompts this reached
        62 of the pool against 43 for the alternative that gets determinism
        by throwing evidence away.

        The set moves as the gate moves, so it is recomputed rather than
        cached. That is a topk over the pool and costs nothing. It means the
        choice is a function of the text and the current weights - which is
        the intent: a boundary should not depend on what was READ before it.

        Costs one forward over `window` characters and two swaps - one into
        the fixed set, one into the chosen one. Paid once per passage in
        training, one chunk in 32,768 characters, and once per reply while
        serving. Every chunk after the first keeps want_experts, which is
        free. The forward is under no_grad, and reading carries 2,048
        characters WITH gradients every chunk, so a chunk without them once
        per passage is not a cost worth trading evidence for.

        BOUNDED, and not only for the cost. `window` defaults to the chunk
        reading uses, so a passage boundary scores the whole chunk it is
        about to read - all of it, not a slice whose size came from
        somewhere else. A prompt is not bounded that way: it is however long
        the conversation has got, and forwarding that in one pass
        materialises every position across every block application at once,
        which is the thing serve.py's chunked prefill exists to avoid, and
        past cfg.block it is not a forward at all but a rotary-table error.

        The tail is what the window takes when it binds. For a prompt that
        is the right end - the last characters are the message being
        answered. For a chunk it never binds, because the window is the
        chunk.
